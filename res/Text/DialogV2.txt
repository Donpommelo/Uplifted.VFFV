Violence Department? Why does this company have a Violence Department?/

Those sound terrible! What were our Founders thinking?/
Employee

Hmm. It makes sense if you think about it. We couldn't have a department of Happiness/because Happiness is a nice thing that the whole company should experience,/not just one department./
Employee

Management only isolates things into their own department if the rest of the/building wants nothing to do with them./

Do you see the Blue tab on this water cooler?/When pressed, a stream of cold water comes out./

I too am looking for something. And like you, I haven't had much in finding it./Perhaps you have heard of the Lux Lacheprie?/

No? Hmm. Oh well. It's a wonderful thing, really./The Lux Lacheprie serves as the source of all the light in the building!/The very light we are using right now to see each other!/

You can think of the Lux Lacheprie as the building's generator. It produces a stream of/radiance which is then packaged and distributed to the rest of the company by prisms./That's why this building has no ceilings./

Say, why don't we cooperate? Yes, us . . . purposeful employees ought to stick together./If you find the Lacheprie, do find a way to tell me. And if I come across this Suite 521/you will be the first to know./

I suppose this plant you see before you is the same tree I happen to be clinging/for my life to. Through this tree, I seem to be able to send messages into the past to you./

However, if you wish to initiate a conversation with me, you¡¦ll have to pay for postage/with Stamps at your Writing Desk./

As mundane as these conversations may be, they may have a profound effect on the/fabric of reality in this building./Remember that failed messages will not cost stamps./
