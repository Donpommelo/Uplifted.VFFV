Violence Department? Why does this company have a Violence Department?/
Employee

The Violence Department was founded by the late Figmous Werbeunroy with the/intention of creating a safer, more peaceful working environment for us employees./
Operator

Peaceful? That doesn't sound right. . ./
Employee
3rdWestOffices-3.png

Figmous believed that violence was an integral part of human nature./To attempt to eradicate violence would be to make the company and its employees/less human.

Employee

Figmous planned to sequester all the violence in the building into one place./This way, The rest of the building is made more peaceful./

What were the other Three?/
Employee

Well, nobody knows for sure, But I think the Departments of Passivity,/Apathy and Suffering were the ones./
Operator
Player-1.png

Those sound terrible! What were our Founders thinking?/
Employee
3rdWestOffices-3.png
1
Hmm. It makes sense if you think about it. We couldn't have a department of Happiness/because Happiness is a nice thing that the whole company should experience,/not just one department./
Employee
3rdWestOffices-3.png
1
Management only isolates things into their own department if the rest of the/building wants nothing to do with them./
Employee
3rdWestOffices-3.png

I think that's more than enough chatter for the quarter. We both have work/that we must refocus our attentions towards./

That hallway to the West leads to the West Wing Offices./

Do you see the Blue tab on this water cooler?/When pressed, a stream of cold water comes out./
Employee

This is because coldness and water are commonly associated with the Blue element . . ./

Likewise, the Red tab represents the Red elemental alignment./
Employee

That's why, when pressed, it releases a destructive gout of fire./
Employee
3rdSouthOffices-1.png

There are several other elements, each with their own unique/abilities, strengths and weaknesses./

Elementally aligned units receive a boost when using abilities of the same color./
