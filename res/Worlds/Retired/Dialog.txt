Violence Department? Why does this company have a Violence Department?/
Receptionist

The Violence Department was founded by the late Figmous Werbeunroy with the/intention of creating a safer, more peaceful working environment for us employees./

Peaceful? That doesn't sound right. . ./
Receptionist

Figmous believed that violence was an integral part of human nature./To attempt to eradicate violence would be to make the company and its employees/less human.

Well. . ./
Receptionist

That is why we instead choose to sequester all the violence in the building into one place./This way, The rest of the building is made more peaceful./

Thanks to us, Operator, you've never been assaulted in your elevator by a disgruntled/passenger. He or she would have come here and assaulted one of us instead./

Something about this floor makes me angry. I'm not very expressive when I'm angry./
Operator

So, what floor for you?/
Employee
3rdSouthOffices-1.png
1
The place to the East of here; man, that's the place to go to release some pent-up/aggression. But violence is pretty strenuous, so make sure you're ready first./

Why don't we go to the Ground Floor?/
Pen Pal
Player-5.png

I'm afraid the 1st floor is currently unavailable. I hear they're getting new carpeting/or something like that./
Operator

Maybe we should try the Second Floor./
Pen Pal

Unfortunately, the entire Second Floor has been reserved for a special occasion./One that we are not invited to./
Operator

Lets go back to the 3rd Floor./
Pen Pal

Perhaps later. The Offices are currently undergoing renovations and I don't like/the smell of paint./
Operator

Do you think we should search the Fourth Floor?/
Pen Pal
Player-5.png

Hmm. I hear one of the Aquarium tanks broke and flooded the whole floor. Maybe we/should go there some other time./
Operator

We haven't looked at the Fifth Floor yet, right?/
Pen Pal
Player-5.png

I don't think management lets normal employees to go there. We would need to find/an alternate route./

Whatabout the Sixth Floor?/
Pen Pal

I think that floor is closed right now. One of the ovens in the Food Servery/caught fire this morning./

How does the Seventh Floor sound to you?/
Pen Pal

I think the Seventh Floor is currently undergoing its monthly dose of/sanitizing radiation. Y'know, to kill germs./
Operator

I think the Eighth Floor is worth a try./

I think the Orchestral Chamber is currently hosting a special concert./

Maybe we should go to the Tenth Floor./
Pen Pal

Tenth Floor? What's a Tenth Floor? I didn't know we had a Tenth Floor in this building./
Operator

Oh. My mistake. I meant to say "Eleventh"./
Pen Pal

Ah. That makes more sense. But I'm afraid Justice Park is currently victim to an hornet/infestation.And I'm not fond of hornets./

Unless I am mistaken, the Gallery of Lights just opened a new exhibit on Minimalism./

I we should go investigate it then./
Pen Pal

Unfortunately, the exhibit is so minimalistic it phased out of existence./Along with the rest of the/floor.

The Violence Department was one of the Four Original Departments of/this company./
Operator

What were the other Three?/
Employee
Jack1small.png

Well, nobody knows for sure, But I think the Departments of Passivity,/Apathy and Suffering were the ones./
Operator

Those sound terrible! What were our Founders thinking?/
Employee
Jack1small.png
1
Hmm. It makes sense if you think about it. We couldn't have a department of Happiness/because Happiness is a nice thing that the whole company should experience,/not just one department./
Employee
Jack1small.png

Management only isolates things into their own department if the rest of the/building wants nothing to do with them./
Employee

Remember, departmentalization is for the unwanted./
